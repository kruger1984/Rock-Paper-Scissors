Browser Game 'Rock-Paper-Scissors': Childhood Memories Transformed into Code.

Remember the days of your childhood when you played 'Rock-Paper-Scissors' with friends? Now, thanks to my code, you can relive those fond memories and even play against the computer.

This captivating game was crafted using JavaScript during my programming education at IT Banda.
It's worth noting that a pre-existing design was used as part of the project, allowing me to focus my efforts on developing the game's logic and user interaction.
In my version of the game, rules were created and implemented, and a scoring system was added to make the gameplay even more engaging.
Play, enjoy, and compete against the computer in the classic game of 'Rock-Paper-Scissors'.
